# Vortex P2P — A 6-Node Blockchain Consensus Demo

> Cloud System midterm project
> M1421070 Hung-Yi Tai · M1429012 Cheng-Han Wu

A from-scratch P2P blockchain demo built with **Python + Flask + Docker + Tailscale**.
No third-party chain, no `web3`, no PoW library — every layer is implemented by hand:
file-based ledger, SHA-256 block chaining, UDP broadcast, heartbeat-driven liveness
detection, dynamic majority consensus, and full network-wide trust freeze /
self-repair after tampering.

## Architecture

The demo runs **6 P2P nodes** spread across two hosts, connected through a
**Tailscale mesh VPN**:

```
        +-------------- Tailscale Network --------------+
        |                                               |
   Host A (100.94.194.29)            Host B (100.122.78.117)
   |-- client1  :8001 / GUI :8081    |-- client1  :8001 / GUI :8081
   |-- client2  :8002 / GUI :8082    |-- client2  :8002 / GUI :8082
   `-- client3  :8003 / GUI :8083    `-- client3  :8003 / GUI :8083

           Node 1 / 2 / 3                  Node 4 / 5 / 6
```

- Each host launches three Ubuntu 22.04 containers via `docker-compose`.
- Containers talk to each other over **UDP 8001-8003** for heartbeat, broadcast,
  and ledger sync.
- Each container also exposes a **Flask Web GUI** (container `:5000` mapped to
  host `:8081/8082/8083`).
- Cross-host traffic always goes over Tailscale IPs — no NAT punching, no public exposure.
- The system **degrades gracefully** when only a subset of the 6 nodes are
  online (minimum quorum: 2 nodes).

## Highlights

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Custom chained ledger | Each `/storage/<n>.txt` is a block (max 5 transactions), linked by SHA-256 |
| Three-layer integrity check | Block-ID contiguity (1..N) + genesis `prev_hash == 0` + per-block hash chain + `latest_hash.txt` head check |
| UDP P2P broadcast | Heartbeat, transactions, hash votes, repair requests, and trust signals all run over UDP — no broker |
| Heartbeat-driven liveness | `PING` every 2 s, peer goes offline after 5 s of silence; status visible in the GUI |
| Dynamic majority consensus | Threshold computed from **live** peers, not a fixed list — works with any subset ≥ 2 nodes |
| Hard quorum floor | Consensus refuses to run with fewer than 2 live nodes (prevents single-node "self-trust") |
| Token-authenticated voting | Every protocol message carries a shared `network_token`; outside packets are dropped |
| Network-wide trust state | Consensus failure broadcasts `BROADCAST_DISTRUST` so **every** node freezes; success broadcasts `BROADCAST_TRUST` to unfreeze |
| Frozen-node guard | Balance / log / transaction operations refuse to run while frozen, with a clear reason |
| Automatic ledger repair | On hash mismatch, a node sends `REQ_SYNC`, gets the full ledger back, overwrites locally, then reports `REPAIR_DONE` |
| Live status panel | Web GUI shows online/offline dots for all 6 nodes, plus a "trusted / frozen" badge |
| One-click demo | `demo.bat` (Windows) and `start_demo.sh` (Linux/macOS) bring everything up and inject 100 random transactions |

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Docker Desktop (Windows / macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- Python 3 (only required when running `auto_tx.py` to seed data)
- For the full 6-node demo across two hosts: install and log into
  [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), then update the Tailscale IPs in
  `app/p2p_main.py` (`ALL_NODES` and `my_ip`) and `app/routes.py` (`NODE_NAME_MAPPING`).

### Single host (3 nodes)

```bash
# 1. (Optional) clean up the previous run's ledger
rm -f ./storage/client{1,2,3}/*.txt

# 2. Start three P2P nodes
docker-compose up -d --build

# 3. Seed test data: SYSTEM airdrop + 100 random transactions
python3 auto_tx.py
```

Open in three browser tabs:

- <http://localhost:8081> — Client 1
- <http://localhost:8082> — Client 2
- <http://localhost:8083> — Client 3

### One-click demo (Windows)

```powershell
demo.bat
```

Menu:

| Option | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Run `start_demo.sh` via Git Bash or WSL (clean ledger → start containers → inject 100 transactions) |
| 2 | Open six browser tabs at once (localhost x3 + remote host x3) |
| 3 | Wipe `storage/client{1,2,3}/*.txt` |
| 0 | Quit |

### One-click demo (Linux / macOS)

```bash
./start_demo.sh
```

Override the displayed host IP if needed:

```bash
HOST_IP=100.94.194.29 ./start_demo.sh
```

---

## Web GUI

Every node serves the same single-page UI:

- **Network status panel** — six dots showing each node's liveness (online / offline / self),
  a `trusted / frozen` badge, and a `online_count / total` counter. Updates every 1.5 s.
- **Balance & log query** — calls `/api/money/<account>` and `/api/log/<account>`.
- **Transaction form** — submits `POST /api/transaction`.
- **Local ledger validation** — calls `/api/checkChain`, which auto-repairs from the majority on mismatch.
- **Network-wide consensus** — calls `/api/checkAllChains/<target>`; awards 100 coins to `<target>` on success.
- **System log terminal** — drains `/api/poll_logs` every 1.5 s and renders multi-line messages with `<br>` line breaks.

Default test accounts seeded by `auto_tx.py`:
`Darren / Alice / Bob / Charlie / Eve`, each starting with 50,000.

---

## Demo Walkthrough

A typical live-demo storyline:

1. **Start the system** and wait a few seconds. The GUI's network status panel
   should light up: 3 dots green (online) + 3 dots grey (offline, the remote host).
   The trust badge reads **trusted**.
2. **Run `auto_tx.py`** to inject 100 random transactions; the log terminal
   streams `[同步] 收到交易 ...` lines on every node.
3. **Tamper with a ledger**, e.g. on Client 2:
   - `docker exec client2 sh -c 'echo "Hacker, Victim, 999" >> /storage/22.txt'`,
     or `rm /storage/1.txt /storage/2.txt`, etc.
4. From a **healthy** node (Client 1), click **Network-wide Consensus**:
   - Initiator broadcasts `REQ_HASH` to every **live** peer.
   - Hash votes are tallied, ignoring `INVALID` / `EMPTY`.
   - Majority is reached → `BROADCAST_MAJORITY` tells the network the right hash.
   - Tampered Client 2 sees its hash differs, sends `REQ_SYNC` to the provider,
     receives the full ledger, wipes `/storage`, and rewrites every block.
   - Client 2 reports `REPAIR_DONE` → initiator logs **"節點 ... 修復完成"**.
   - Initiator's hash matches the majority → 100-coin SYSTEM reward, then
     `BROADCAST_TRUST` keeps the network's trust badge green.
5. **Force a no-majority scenario** by tampering Client 1 and Client 2 with
   different content, then run consensus from Client 3:
   - Result: `未達過半 (1/3)` — `BROADCAST_DISTRUST` fires.
   - Every node's badge turns **frozen**.
   - Try Balance / Log / Transaction on any node: all rejected with the reason
     `來自 ... 的全網共識失敗通知（無法達成過半數共識 ...）`.
6. **Recover** by restoring the tampered ledgers (manually copy a healthy
   storage, or wait for a node that does match the truth) and rerun consensus.
   Once a majority forms, `BROADCAST_TRUST` unfreezes the entire network in one round.

## REST API

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/` | Web GUI home page |
| GET | `/api/peers` | Live status for all 6 nodes + `network_trusted` / `network_trusted_reason` |
| GET | `/api/money/<account>` | Balance (`null` if local ledger invalid or network frozen) |
| GET | `/api/log/<account>` | Transactions involving the account (empty array if frozen) |
| POST | `/api/transaction` | Body: `{"sender","receiver","amount"}`; returns 400 with reason if frozen |
| GET | `/api/checkChain` | Validates the local chain; auto-repairs from the majority on mismatch |
| GET | `/api/checkAllChains/<target>` | Runs network-wide consensus; rewards `<target>` with 100 on success |
| GET | `/api/poll_logs` | Drains and returns the node log buffer |
| GET | `/api/stats` | Returns total transaction count |

> `sender = "SYSTEM"` is a privileged account that bypasses balance and trust
> checks (used for the genesis airdrop and consensus rewards).

Sample `/api/peers` response:

```json
{
  "peers": [
    {"node_id":"100.94.194.29-8001","name":"Node 1","ip":"100.94.194.29","port":8001,
     "online":true,"is_self":true,"last_seen_ago":0},
    {"node_id":"100.94.194.29-8002","name":"Node 2","ip":"100.94.194.29","port":8002,

    ...
  ],
  "online_count": 3,
  "total": 6,
  "network_trusted": true,
  "network_trusted_reason": ""
}
```

## P2P Message Protocol

All nodes exchange plain-text UDP datagrams on ports 8001-8003.
Every authenticated message carries `network_token = "MY_BLOCKCHAIN_SECRET_2026"`.

### Heartbeat

| Message | Direction | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PING:<node_id>:<token>` | every 2 s, broadcast | Keepalive; receiver replies with `PONG` and updates `peer_last_seen` |
| `PONG:<node_id>:<token>` | reply | Updates the sender's view of who's online |

### Transactions & Ledger Sync

| Message | Direction | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TX:<sender>:<receiver>:<amount>` | broadcast | Replicate a transaction; receivers append it to their local ledger |
| `REQ_HASH` | 1 → N (live peers only) | Ask peers to report the SHA-256 of their latest block |
| `RESP_HASH:<hash>:<node_id>:<token>` | N → 1 | Hash reply; packets with a wrong `token` are dropped |
| `REQ_SYNC` | point-to-point | Damaged node asks the provider for the full ledger |
| `RESP_SYNC:<json>` | provider → damaged node | Full ledger as JSON; receiver wipes `/storage` and rewrites every file |
| `REPAIR_DONE:<node_id>` | damaged node → initiator | Confirms repair completion |

### Consensus & Trust Broadcast

| Message | Direction | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BROADCAST_MAJORITY:<hash>:<provider_id>:<initiator_id>` | initiator → live peers | Announce the majority hash and where to fetch it from |
| `BROADCAST_DISTRUST:<reason>:<initiator_id>:<token>` | initiator → live peers | Consensus failed (no majority / all invalid) — every receiver freezes itself |
| `BROADCAST_TRUST:<initiator_id>:<token>` | initiator → live peers | Consensus succeeded with initiator in the majority — every receiver unfreezes |

`<reason>` strings never contain `:` (initiator replaces any with the full-width
`：` so the protocol parser stays simple).

---

## Ledger File Format

Every container mounts its own `/storage`:

```
storage/client1/
├── 1.txt
├── 2.txt
├── ...
└── latest_hash.txt
```

Each `<n>.txt` is one block:

```
Sha256 of previous block: <sha256 of the previous file (or "0" for block 1)>
Next block: <n+1>.txt or None
sender, receiver, amount
sender, receiver, amount
... (up to 5 entries)
```

- Block 1's `Sha256 of previous block:` is hard-coded to `0` (genesis marker).
- Once a block reaches 5 transactions, a new file is created. The old block's
  `Next block:` line is updated, and the new block records the previous block's hash.
- `latest_hash.txt` always stores the SHA-256 of the most recent block. This
  catches attacks that only modify the latest block while leaving every earlier
  `prev_hash` intact.

---

## Ledger Integrity Checks

`P2PNode._check_chain_unlocked()` runs four layered checks. If any layer fails
the chain is reported `INVALID`, every consensus / balance / transaction call is
refused, and consensus from a peer can repair it:

1. **Empty-ledger discrimination** —
   - No blocks **and** no `latest_hash.txt` → genesis (legitimate, allows the
     first transaction to be written).
   - No blocks **but** `latest_hash.txt` exists → "all blocks deleted" attack,
     reported as `所有帳本區塊遺失`.
2. **Block-ID contiguity** — actual block IDs must be exactly `[1, 2, …, N]`.
   Deletions, renumbering, or fake gaps surface as
   `區塊編號不連續 (缺漏: [...], 多餘: [...])`.
3. **Genesis check** — block 1's `Sha256 of previous block:` must be `0`.
   Otherwise `創世區塊 1.txt 的 prev_hash 不是 0`.
4. **Prev-hash chain & head check** — for every consecutive pair, recorded
   `prev_hash` must match the actual SHA-256 of the previous file. The last
   file's hash must match `latest_hash.txt`.

| Tampering | Detection layer |
| --- | --- |
| Edit middle / earlier block content | (4) prev-hash chain breaks |
| Edit last block content | (4) `latest_hash.txt` mismatch |
| Delete middle block | (2) contiguity break (gap) |
| Delete oldest blocks (1, 2, …) | (2) actual IDs start above 1 |
| Delete every numbered block | (1) `latest_hash.txt` still present |
| Inject a fake "0.txt" earlier than genesis | (3) prev_hash of new earliest block isn't 0 |
| Delete last blocks but keep `latest_hash.txt` | (4) head hash mismatch |

---

## Heartbeat & Live-Node Consensus

`P2PNode._heartbeat_loop()` runs in its own thread:

- Every `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 2` seconds, send `PING:<node_id>:<token>` to all peers.
- Receiver replies with `PONG:<node_id>:<token>` (also treats the incoming
  `PING` as proof of life, updating its own `peer_last_seen`).
- Anyone whose last `PONG` is older than `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT = 5` seconds is
  considered offline.

`get_live_peer_ids()` returns the current online set; `get_peer_status()`
returns the structured rows that drive the GUI.

Consensus uses the **live count**, not the static peer list:

```python
total_expected = len(live_peers) + 1   # +1 = self
if total_expected < MIN_QUORUM_NODES:  # MIN_QUORUM_NODES = 2
    return "存活節點不足 (X/2)"
if max_count > total_expected / 2:
    # majority reached — the chain that wins is whatever ≥ 50%+1 of
    # the live nodes vote for, regardless of how many are offline
```

This means:

- 6 nodes online → majority needs ≥ 4
- 3 nodes online → majority needs ≥ 2
- 1 node online → consensus refuses (quorum floor)

`BROADCAST_MAJORITY` and `BROADCAST_DISTRUST / TRUST` are also targeted at the
live set only — there's no point spamming offline peers with UDP datagrams.

---

## Network Trust State (Freeze / Unfreeze)

Each node holds `self.network_trusted` (default `True`). The state changes
**only** in `_execute_checkAllChains` after a consensus run:

| Outcome | Initiator's local change | What's broadcast |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Live nodes < 2 | unchanged | nothing |
| All votes `INVALID` / `EMPTY` | `False`, reason: `全網均無效帳本` | `BROADCAST_DISTRUST` |
| Majority found, my hash matches | `True`, reason cleared | `BROADCAST_TRUST` |
| Majority found, my hash differs (I'm being repaired) | unchanged this round; next consensus run promotes to `True` | `BROADCAST_MAJORITY` (repair) |
| No majority (e.g. 1/3) | `False`, reason: `無法達成過半數共識 (X/Y)` | `BROADCAST_DISTRUST` |

Receivers handle the broadcasts unconditionally:

- `BROADCAST_DISTRUST` → set `network_trusted = False`, record reason as
  *"來自 X 的全網共識失敗通知（…）"*.
- `BROADCAST_TRUST` → set `network_trusted = True`, clear reason.

While a node is frozen, `_require_network_trust` blocks:

- `_execute_checkMoney` → returns `None` and logs `查詢餘額已凍結`.
- `_execute_checkLog` → returns `[]` and logs `查詢明細已凍結`.
- `_execute_transaction` (non-SYSTEM) → raises `ValueError(交易已凍結 …)` which
  the route layer turns into HTTP 400.

`SYSTEM` transactions (consensus rewards, genesis airdrop) bypass the trust
check, so the post-consensus 100-coin reward still goes out.

---

## Consensus & Self-Repair

`P2PNode._execute_checkAllChains()` is the heart of the system:

1. **Vote request** — broadcast `REQ_HASH` to every **live** peer (live = last
   `PONG` within 5 s).
2. **Collect votes** — within `SYNC_WAIT_SECONDS = 2`, accept only `RESP_HASH`
   replies that carry the right token and come from a peer in `nodes_contact_book`.
3. **Quorum gate** — if `total_expected < MIN_QUORUM_NODES`, refuse the run
   (state untouched).
4. **Tally** — count with `Counter`, ignoring `INVALID` and `EMPTY`.
5. **Decide** — declare consensus only when `max_count > total_expected / 2`.
6. **Announce** — send `BROADCAST_MAJORITY` so every live node knows the right
   hash and provider.
7. **Self-repair** — any node whose local hash differs from the majority sends
   `REQ_SYNC` to the provider. The provider replies with `RESP_SYNC:<json>`;
   the receiver wipes `/storage` and rewrites every file.
8. **Report back** — the repaired node sends `REPAIR_DONE` to the initiator,
   which logs `節點 ... 修復完成`.
9. **Reward & trust** — if the initiator's own hash matches the majority, it
   credits 100 coins to `<target>`, broadcasts the matching `TX:` message, and
   sends `BROADCAST_TRUST` to clear any frozen state on peers.
10. **Failure path** — if no majority, the initiator freezes itself and
    broadcasts `BROADCAST_DISTRUST`, freezing every live peer too.

Defensive design choices:

- **Token check** blocks unauthorized hash injection.
- **Keying votes by `sender_id`** prevents a single malicious peer from stuffing replies.
- **Filtering `INVALID` / `EMPTY`** keeps broken nodes from skewing the majority.
- **Live-peer scoping** — heartbeat-derived live set is the denominator, so
  offline peers don't artificially raise the majority bar.
- **Hard quorum floor** — refuses to run with fewer than 2 live nodes, blocking
  the degenerate "alone, therefore trusted" case.
- **Pre-write validation** — every transaction calls `_check_chain_unlocked()`
  first, so an unhealthy node refuses to write new entries until repair finishes.

## FAQ

**Q1. The demo broke after I changed an IP — why?**
Several Tailscale IPs are hard-coded: `ALL_NODES` and `my_ip` in `app/p2p_main.py`,
plus `NODE_NAME_MAPPING` in `app/routes.py`. Update all three together.

**Q2. Why is the `demo.bat` menu in English only?**
`cmd.exe` parses `.bat` files using the system ANSI codepage (cp950 on zh-TW),
which mangles UTF-8 Chinese characters into bogus commands. Plain ASCII is the
safest choice.

**Q3. Why do my freshly-restarted peers show "offline" for the first ~5 seconds?**
Heartbeat needs a full round-trip (PING → PONG) before `peer_last_seen` is
populated. Until that arrives, every peer is treated as offline. Once the first
`PONG` lands the dot turns green; with `INTERVAL=2 s` and `TIMEOUT=5 s` you
should see a stable green within 4-5 seconds of startup.

**Q4. The badge went red after a tampering test — how do I clear it?**
Restore the tampered ledger(s) and re-run **Network-wide Consensus** on a
healthy node. As soon as a majority is reached, `BROADCAST_TRUST` flips every
peer back to green in one round. Until that happens, balance / log / transaction
operations are blocked on every node.

**Q5. Can I run with only 3 nodes (one host)?**
Yes — that's the default configuration. With three nodes online the live
denominator is 3 and the majority threshold drops to 2. Stopping any single
node still leaves 2/2 consensus working; stopping two of them trips the quorum
floor and consensus refuses to run.

**Q6. Can I run more than 6 nodes?**
Yes. Add the new entry to `ALL_NODES`, declare additional services in
`docker-compose.yml`, and expose the matching UDP port. Update `NODE_NAME_MAPPING`
in `app/routes.py` so the GUI can label the new nodes.

**Q7. Why do failed transactions tell me the network is frozen?**
A previous consensus run reported no majority (or all invalid), broadcasting
`BROADCAST_DISTRUST` to every live peer. Re-run consensus once the underlying
ledger problem is resolved to receive `BROADCAST_TRUST` and unfreeze the network.
